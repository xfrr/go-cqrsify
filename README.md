- **Clean Architecture:** Easy-to-follow templates and utilities for organizing code in line with Clean Architecture principles.
- **Event-Sourcing:** Utilities for implementing event-sourcing in your applications, including event stores, event publishers, and subscribers.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components to facilitate the development of event-driven systems, enabling loosely coupled components to communicate efficiently.
